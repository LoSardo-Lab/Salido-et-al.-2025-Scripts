# Salido-et-al.-2025-Scripts
Scripts used in the Lo Sardo lab's 2025 publication by Salido et al.

Please note that the 'Gene Ontology Analysis' and 'iPSC-VSMC Pseudotime analysis' scripts both use outputs generated in the 'iPSC-VSMC QC, Clustering, Differential Expression Analysis, and Basic Figures' script. The pseudotime script requires the clustered seurat object, and the gene ontology script requires the clustered seurat object as well as a table generated by the differential expression analysis in the 'iPSC-VSMC QC, Clustering, Differential Expression Analysis, and Basic Figures' script
